1. Please disregard the .zip with the word "copy." The second file is the one I'd like to submit.

2. For theatrical productions, spring and summer are the seasons most likely to be successful. May and December were the best and worst
months, respectively.

3. For plays, there wasn't a strong correlation between goal amount and outcome (i.e. setting  higher goal didn't appear to decrease 
the probability of reaching it).

4. One limitation of the data set is that we don't know if some genres or archetypes are more likely than others to result in a successful
Kickstarter campaign for a play or other type of theatrical production. Are comedies more likely to succeed, or dramas? Period pieces or
present day? Tragedies or stories with happy endings? I'd really be curious.
